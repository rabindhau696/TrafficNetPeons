TNP™ is a business founded upon integrating municipalities with their commuters. The success of our current project hinges upon providing comprehensive and secure technology to traffic monitoring officials so that they might deliver the best possible service to their communities. In further detail, to accomplish this the traffic monitoring camera we are currently engaged in the design of must be mass produced, field deployed and easily accessible only to those persons authorized in its daily usage. Only at such time when our team can confidently expect our product to be adopted by surrounding municipalities for mass use in the outdoor environment can we say we have succeeded.
